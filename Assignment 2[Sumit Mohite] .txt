Q1. What is JDBC Driver? Please explain in detail.
->  - JDBC Is nothing but Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an application programming interface (API) for the programming language Java,which defines how a 
      client may access any kind of tabular data,especially relational database.
	- It acts as a middle layer interface between java applications and database.
	- JDBC classes are contained in the Java Package java.sql and javax.sql.
	- There are 4 types of JDBC drivers:
		-- driver or JDBC-ODBC bridge driver:- Its uses ODBC driver to connect to the database.
		-- driver or Native-API driver:- it uses the clientside libraries of the database.This driver converts JDBC method calls into native calls of the database API.
		-- driver or Network Protocol driver:-here all the database connectivity drivers are present in a single server,hence no need of individual client-side installation.
		-- driver or Thin driver:-This driver interact directly with database. It does not require any native database library.
	
Q2. What are the JDBC API components?
->  There are JDBC API Components
	- DriverManager
	- Driver
	- Connection
	- Statement
	- ResultSet
	- SQLException
	
Q3. What are the differences between Statement and PreparedStatement interface?
-> Statement :- 
		1.It is used when SQL query is to be executed only once.
		2.Performance is very low.
		3.It is base interface.
		4.It is used for DDL statements.
		5.Used for CREATE, ALTER, DROP statements.
   
   PreparedStatement:-
		1.It is used when SQL query is to be executed multiple times.
		2.Performance is better than Statement.
		3.It extends statement interface.
		4.It is used for any SQL Query.
		5.Used for the queries which are to be executed multiple times.
					  
Q4. What is the major difference between java.util.Date and java.sql.Date data type?
-> 	java.sql.Date - Its just represent DATE without time information.
	java.util.Date - Its justrepresents both Date and Time information.This is the major difference why java.util.Date can not directly map to java.sql.Date.

Q5. What do you understand by Reflection in Java programming language?
-> 	Reflection in java is an API which is used to examine or modify the behavior of methods,classes,interfaces at runtime.The required classes for reflection 
    are provided under java.lang.reflect package.Reflection gives us information about the class to which an object belongs and also the methods of that class 
	which can be executed by using the object.Through reflection we can invoke methods at runtime irrespective of the access specifier used with them.

Q6. What is Gang of Four (GOF)?
->  Gang Of Four (GOF) refers to the authors of the book: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software

Q7. What is Factory pattern and Abstract factory pattern?
->  In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.
    Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories. Abstract factory pattern implementation provides us with a 
	framework that allows us to create objects that follow a general pattern.So at runtime, the abstract factory is coupled with any desired concrete
	factory which can create objects of the desired type.

Q8. What is Singleton pattern? How can you create Singleton class in java?
->  In object-oriented programming, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time. 
    After first time, if we try to instantiate the Singleton class, the new variable also points to the first instance created.Remember the key points 
	while defining class as singleton class that is while designing a singleton class:
	 - Make constructor private.
	 - Write a static method that has return type object of this singleton class. Here, the concept of Lazy initialization is used to write this static method.

Q9. What is a version control system (VCS) and what is git repository?
->  Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control 
    systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
    Repositories in GIT contain a collection of files of various different versions of a Project. These files are imported from the 
	repository into the local server of the user for further updations and modifications in the content of the file. 	

Q10. Can you explain head in terms of git and also tell the number of heads that can be 
present in a repository?
-> HEAD points to the starting point of the present branch in the repository at all times.It can be thought of as the last state or the last checked 
   out point in a repository. If we are viewing the master branch, then “master” is also our HEAD. If we are not viewing the master branch, then whatever
   branch or commit we are viewing is our HEAD.
